9/6/2018 - This is a modified version of Dr. Chuck's YouTube Analytics Tsugi tool.

This work is a simplified version of the Video tracking / commenting
Tsugi tool that Clara Nees produced in 2014 as part of an independent study.

Claras tool built interactivity around a YouTube video - this tool just has tracking
and launching.  Much of this code was inspired by Clara's work.
